This is a Graphics Engine I made using OpenGL. The folders inside the project that are not mine are GLFW, glm and AssImp.

The engine using Phong Lighting for the 3D meshes and can also do 2D rendering, I've listed the functions that this engine can run at the bottom of this document.

The Build/Demo consists of a 3D render of a monster on the right, a 2D diamond and two balls falling and bouncing in a box using a simple physics engine I made on the left.

The 3D draw functions avaiable are Draw Indexed Textured Mesh and the 2D shapes available are Circles, Lines, Quadralaterals, Triangles, Crosses and Custom Shapes which take a list of points.




How to run the Demo Build:

1. Open the Build folder.

2. Run GraphicsTest.exe.




How to Run visual studio project:

1. Open the Graphics Engine folder, and unzip the AssImp zip file.
(This was zipped due to the push limitation on a free github account.)

2. Open the GraphicsTest.sln and run visual studio when prompted. 

3. Click Run.
